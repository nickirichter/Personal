Here's the updated sequences and grep/sed lines


//Pulls any line out that has CMD in it into cmds.txt
grep 'CMD ' ../procs/panelqry.prc  > cmds.txt


(sed note: -i //changes the file -e //prints out an example of what the file would change to)

//Updates any line with "CMD ADC" to cmd ADC_cmd_
// Case doesn't matter with CMD
sed -i 's/^CMD ADC /cmd ADC_cmd_/g' seqPANELQRY.txt 

//Removes all commas
sed -e 's/,//g' seqPANELQRY.txt

//Removes all "with "
sed -e 's/with //g' seqPANELQRY.txt
